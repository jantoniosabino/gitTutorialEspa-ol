# gitApuntes

Hi! Don't pay attention on this repository. 
I'm starting to learn git and markdown along the way.
I thought I could create a git tutorial on nextjs step by step, with test at the end on nextjs, but at the moment I just use this repository for self-study like a cheatsheet

kind regards!
